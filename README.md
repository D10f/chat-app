# Node.js and Socket.io web application

A very simple web application to chat online. It uses Node.js and Socket.io as a backend, and handlebars templating engine in the front-end along with Bulma CSS for the styling. This repository is the result of a code along one of the projects from Andrew Mead's "The Complete Node.js Developer Course".
